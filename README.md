# CSV2DS

When discussing features or asking for programming help, sharing a minimum 
working example (MWE) is often required. In my experience with SAS software, the
data source causing questions is often not directly entered into a SAS 
data step but brought in from an outside source such as an Excel or CSV file
or similar. When creating an MWE it is then necessary to manually create a 
data step. This program is intended to make that process quicker and easier. 
The goal of the program is to iterate over a given CSV file and convert it 
to a simple SAS data step template.
